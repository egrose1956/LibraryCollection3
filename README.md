To use this application:

The first run of the application installs an empty sqlite database. Updates leave the data intact.

The first order of business is to add an author. A title can be added at this time but is not required. With the author data remaining on the page, title after title for that author may be saved; or, the author field's data may be changed to enter a new author/title.

Once the author and title have been entered, the title may be viewed. From there the title details may be entered on subsequent views. These details include additional narrators for audio titles.

New narrators and new authors may be entered from menu items on the main screen. Lists of authors, titles and narrators may be shown on the main screen.

Searches may be done on author Last Name or Title.
